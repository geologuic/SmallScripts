## To generate type information and doc of pybind11 Python functions in virtual environment (to be read by PyCharm for completion, tooltips, checks and other static analyzes)

Before all, need to install pybind11-stubgen in virtual environment:
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install pybind11-stubgen
```

After that, install / upgrading the wheel (here: ring_point_process), and generate the pyi information: 
```
uv pip install ring_pointprocess-5.6.2-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl
pybind11-stubgen.exe -o .\.venv\Lib\site-packages\. ring_pointprocess.ring_pointprocess_py_spp    
```
The last argument should be the name as the .pyd file (without version info) in the site-packages directory.


## To find where Qt dlls are in the PATH

```
$env:path -split ';' | Get-ChildItem | Format-Table Fullname | findstr Qt.*.dll
```

In the above command: 
 * `env:path_` returns the PATH (with ; as separators)
 * `Get-ChildItem | Format-Table Fullname` list the files under the current PATH directory, and shows the full file name
 * `findstr` looks for the substring in the full file name. Regular expression is slighly different as Linux: . means any char and * any number

## To look for DLL dependencies without installing the dependency walker

```
 & "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin\dumpbin.exe" /dependents your_dll_or_exe_file
```
The '&' tells PS to call the executable.
